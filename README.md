# Development
- Start by creating index HTML and its styling.
- Create JavaScript which modifies the DOM element to pick an element from array. This is done by using even listener for click even on the button.
- Javascript involves incrementing the counter and picking corresponding element from array which cotains information like author, job title and bio. This is then displayed using an event listener for click event on the button.
